Tests in this directory are in the process of restructuring. The following folders highlight the desired form:

- `Builtins`, with subfolders for builtin functions as well as bytecode support functions.
- `Generic`, with subfolders for the implementations of particular algorithms and other real-world-like scenarios.
- `Patterns`, with subfolders for particular common usage scenarios. 
- `Syntax`, with subfolders for particular syntactical features.
- `Types`, with subfolders for individual core types.

All tests will be migrated over time.
